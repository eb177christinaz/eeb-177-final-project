Final Project Proposal 

(Original Project Proposal was placed under Homework since my repository wasn't working, but I've since changed my project idea. The last one was difficult to find data sets from.)

My proposed families are: 
-Strigiformes (Owls)
-Chiroptera (Bats)
-Canidae (Dogs)

I added an extra set of Ailuridae (Red Pandas), but since there are so few records on the species, I may simply use it as simple testing data for my codes. 

To find the number of specific species in each family, use: 
cut -d "," -f 6-7 [FILE NAME] | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l

cut -d "," -f 6-7 strigiformesdataset.csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
	Strigiformes has 76 unique species
cut -d "," -f 6-7 chiropteradataset.csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
	Chiroptera has 436 unique species
cut -d "," -f 6-7 canidaedataset.csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
	Canidae has 383 unique species
cut -d "," -f 6-7 redpandadataset\(practice\).csv | sort -n | uniq | grep "species" | wc -l
	Ailuridae has 15 unique species
